# Shoppers-purchase-intent
Using a K-neighbours-classifer machine learning algorithm to determine if a user will purchase an item or not

##
The idea of this project is that based on user data from a shopping website, it is possible to create a machine learning program that can take this data and predict wether a user will go through with a purchase or not. The program was trained on over 11, 000+ user sessions, with each session representing data such as their region, the date, wether it was a holiday, wether they were a returning user, their OS and other such data (given in the shoppers.csv file)

I used a K-neighbours-classifer implemented with sci-kit learn for this project. Sensitivity represents the true positive rate (accurately identified as going through with a purchase) and Specificity represents the true negative rate.
